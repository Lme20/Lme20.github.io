## 1. Installation

As for a fast preview, you can use the following link to see the program in action: [WeatherApp Github page](https://lme20.github.io/WeatherApp/)

### 1.1 First step

To be able to use the program in your own environment, make sure to download the zip file from the Github repository: 

                            https://github.com/Lme20/WeatherApp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Once done, proceed by opening the project in VScode or your IDE of choice. 

### 1.2 Live preview

Due to the simplicity of this program, its usage is only possible through a live preview. This can be done by either using an extension specifically for launching a local development server. In this case, as I use VScode I have opted for [Live server preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) as my main extension to visualise the program. 

## 2. Usage

Using WeatherApp is very simple, write down your city of choice and the program will show its current weather. You can both press enter or simply click on the search lens.
